-- | This operation is based on the Uniplate @universe@ function. Given a
--   list of trees, it returns those trees, and all the children trees at
--   any level. For example:
--
-- > universeTree
-- >    [TagBranch "a" [("href","url")] [TagBranch "b" [] [TagLeaf (TagText "text")]]]
-- > == [TagBranch "a" [("href","url")] [TagBranch "b" [] [TagLeaf (TagText "text")]]]
-- >    ,TagBranch "b" [] [TagLeaf (TagText "text")]]
--
--   This operation is particularly useful for queries. To collect all @\"a\"@
--   tags in a tree, simply do:
--
-- > [x | x@(TagTree "a" _ _) <- universeTree tree]
universeTree :: [TagTree str] -> [TagTree str]
universeTree = concatMap f
    where
        f t@(TagBranch _ _ inner) = t : universeTree inner

-- | This operation is based on the Uniplate @transform@ function. Given a
--   list of trees, it applies the function to every tree in a bottom-up
--   manner. This operation is useful for manipulating a tree - for example
--   to make all tag names upper case:
--
-- > upperCase = transformTree f
-- >   where f (TagBranch name atts inner) = [TagBranch (map toUpper name) atts inner]
-- >         f x = x
transformTree :: (TagTree str -> [TagTree str]) -> [TagTree str] -> [TagTree str]
transformTree act = concatMap f

        f x = act x
